# Master Thesis
Repository of the final scripts for my Master's thesis.

The scripts used are listed in their folders below. The numbers refer to the order in which the scripts are used.

## R:
1. demographics.R – age and sex for different groups
2. Sampling_test_training.R - create training and testing sets
5. Calculate-averages.R - calculate LSTM-VAE latent construct averages per participant
7. final_glm_SFS_CNN.R - GLM's to compare to CNN-VAE and SFS

## TensorFlow:
3. final_LSTM_VAE_model – notebook containing the LSTM-VAE model
Also includes final vae, encoder, decoder weights and models

## MATLAB:
4. unique_coord_transform_rot_contraints_withinLSTM - check rotational equivalence of various LSTM-VAE model versions
6. unique_coord_transform_rot_contraints_CNNandLSTM - check rotational equivalence of average CNN-VAE and LSTM-VAE latent construct values
